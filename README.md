# Control Flow

## Using if, elif, and else statements to control flow
## Using _for_ and _while_ loops

- while loops are not regularly used but are still very useful in some cases
- keywords used ``break`` and ``continue`` that help control flow
- Uses syntax to continuously perform an action while a condition is still true, unless told otherwise with one of the keywords mentioned above.:

```
while something_is_true:
    do this

    if specific_condition:
        break
```
